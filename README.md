## üèÜ Hackathon Project Overview

This project was developed for a hackathon focused on implementing **Hush's consent protocol** into agentic systems. Our team created a sophisticated calendar management system that prioritizes user consent at every step, ensuring that AI agents only perform actions with explicit user permission.

## üéØ Project Vision

The core philosophy of our system is **"Consent First"** - no action is performed without explicit user authorization. We've built an agentic system that breaks down complex calendar tasks into atomic operations, each requiring individual consent through a robust trustlink mechanism.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Components

Our system is built around a **User Agent** that orchestrates multiple specialized sub-agents, all powered by Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK).

```
User Input ‚Üí User Agent ‚Üí Task Pipeline ‚Üí Execution Loop ‚Üí Calendar Operations
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì            ‚Üì              ‚Üì               ‚Üì
 Raw Request ‚Üí Task Analysis ‚Üí Consent Flow ‚Üí Trustlink ‚Üí MCP Tools
```

### Agent Hierarchy

#### 1. **User Agent** (Root Orchestrator)
- **File**: `agents/user_agent.py`
- **Purpose**: Central coordinator that manages the entire workflow
- **Key Features**:
  - Fetches current date/time context using `fetch_date_time` operon
  - Routes requests to appropriate agent pipelines
  - Manages overall system state and user interaction

#### 2. **Task List Pipeline** (Sequential Agent)
A three-stage sequential pipeline that processes raw user requests:

##### 2.1 Intent Extractor Agent
- **File**: `agents/intent_extractor_agent.py`
- **Purpose**: Breaks down natural language requests into atomic tasks
- **Output**: Structured list of individual tasks (one CRUD operation per task)

##### 2.2 Sub-Agent MCP Tool Identifier Agent
- **File**: `agents/subagent_mcp_identifier_agent.py`
- **Purpose**: Maps each task to appropriate sub-agents and MCP tools
- **Features**:
  - Queries available MCP tools using `calendar_mcp_tool`
  - Assigns specific tools to each task
  - Prevents hallucination by only using verified tool data

##### 2.3 Scope Identifier Agent
- **File**: `agents/scope_identifier_agent.py`
- **Purpose**: Determines required consent scopes for each task
- **Integration**: Works with Hush consent framework to define permission levels

#### 3. **Calendar Executor Loop Agent**
- **File**: `agents/calendar_executor_loop_agent.py`
- **Purpose**: Orchestrates task execution with consent validation
- **Workflow**:
  1. Processes tasks sequentially (one at a time)
  2. Updates task status: `pending` ‚Üí `in_progress` ‚Üí `completed/failed`
  3. Coordinates between Trustlink Agent and Calendar Agent
  4. Manages state consistency across the workflow

#### 4. **Trustlink Agent**
- **File**: `agents/trustlink_agent.py`
- **Purpose**: Handles user consent and trustlink generation
- **Features**:
  - **Always asks for explicit user consent** before proceeding
  - Generates trustlinks using `generate_trustlink` operon
  - Blocks execution until consent is obtained
  - Creates delegation tokens for secure agent communication

#### 5. **Calendar Agent**
- **File**: `agents/calendar_agent.py`
- **Purpose**: Executes calendar operations via MCP tools
- **Security Features**:
  - **Always validates trustlinks** before any operation
  - Uses `validate_trustlink` operon for verification
  - Only processes tasks marked as "in_progress"
  - Connects to dockerized Google Calendar MCP server

## üõ°Ô∏è Consent & Security Framework

### Trustlink System
Our custom trustlink mechanism ensures secure delegation between agents:

- **Generation**: Created by Trustlink Agent after user consent
- **Validation**: Verified by Calendar Agent before execution
- **Scope**: Contains specific permissions for individual tasks
- **Security**: One-time use tokens that prevent unauthorized access

### Consent Scopes
Defined in `agents/calendar_agent/utils.py`:

```python
AGENT_GCAL_READ    # Read calendar data
AGENT_GCAL_WRITE   # Modify calendar data
```

### MCP Tool Registry
Our system supports the following Google Calendar operations:

| Tool | Description | Consent Scope |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| `list-calendars` | Fetch all accessible calendars | READ |
| `list-events` | Retrieve calendar events | READ |
| `search-events` | Search events by keywords/date | READ |
| `create-event` | Create new calendar events | WRITE |
| `update-event` | Modify existing events | WRITE |
| `delete-event` | Remove calendar events | WRITE |
| `list-colors` | Get available color codes | READ |

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)
- **Language**: Python
- **Consent Protocol**: Hush Framework
- **Calendar Integration**: Google Calendar MCP Server (Dockerized)
- **Architecture**: Multi-agent system with sequential pipelines

### Key Features

1. **Sequential Task Processing**: Tasks are executed one by one to maintain control and consent verification
2. **State Management**: Comprehensive task status tracking (pending/in_progress/completed/failed)
3. **Error Handling**: Retry mechanisms with graceful failure handling
4. **Consent Validation**: Multi-layer consent verification at every step
5. **Tool Isolation**: Each MCP tool requires specific consent scopes

### Custom Operons

We developed several custom operons (functions), although in our project we only use some of these for system operations:

- `generate_trustlink`: Creates secure delegation tokens
- `validate_trustlink`: Verifies token authenticity and scope
- `fetch_date_time`: Provides current temporal context
- `calendar_mcp_tool`: Tool registry and metadata management


## üìã Usage Examples

### Basic Calendar Operations

```
User: "Schedule a meeting with John tomorrow at 2 PM"

System Flow:
1. Intent Extractor: Break into atomic tasks
2. Tool Identifier: Map to create-event tool
3. Scope Identifier: Assign WRITE permission
4. Trustlink Agent: Ask user consent
5. Calendar Agent: Execute after validation
```

### Complex Multi-step Operations

```
User: "Find my free time this week and schedule a team meeting"

System Flow:
1. Task 1: Search existing events (READ scope)
2. Task 2: Identify free slots (READ scope)  
3. Task 3: Create new meeting (WRITE scope)
Each task requires individual consent approval
```

## üéØ Key Achievements

1. **Consent-First Architecture**: Every operation requires explicit user approval
2. **Atomic Task Decomposition**: Complex requests broken into manageable units
3. **Secure Agent Communication**: Trustlink system prevents unauthorized actions
4. **Flexible Tool Integration**: Modular MCP tool registry system
5. **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful failure recovery and user feedback

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

While we focused on core Google Calendar MCP tools for this hackathon, our operon registry includes additional functionality for future expansion:

- Advanced scheduling algorithms
- Multi-calendar synchronization
- Smart meeting suggestions
- Conflict resolution automation
- Integration with additional calendar providers

## üèÖ Hackathon Impact

This project demonstrates how consent protocols can be seamlessly integrated into agentic systems without sacrificing functionality. By prioritizing user control and transparent operations, we've created a model for ethical AI agent design that respects user privacy while delivering powerful automation capabilities.
